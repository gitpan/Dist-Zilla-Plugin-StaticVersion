NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::StaticVersion - Specify version number manually,
    using a plugin

VERSION
    version 0.103521

SYNOPSIS
    In a plugin bundle:

        package Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::SomePlugins;
        use Moose;
        with 'Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle::Easy';
        sub configure {
            ...
            $self->add_plugins(
                ['StaticVersion' => { version => "1.14.3" } ],
            );
            ...
        }

    In dist.ini:

        [StaticVersion]
        version = 1.14.3

    which is equivalent to:

        version = 1.14.3

DESCRIPTION
    This purpose of this plugin is to allow plugin bundles or other such
    things to specify a specific version number. This allows one to write a
    pluginbundle that decides based on its configuration whether to offer a
    specific version number. You could not otherwise do this, because a
    static version number is specified before any plugins in dist.ini.

    You shouldn't need to use this plugin directly in your dist.ini.

METHODS
  provide_version
    This method simply offers the specified version. If the specified
    version is false (e.g. empty string), it will not be offered.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    This module is under ten lines of code. It is likely provably correct.
    Regardless, please report any bugs or feature requests to
    "rct+perlbug@thompsonclan.org".
